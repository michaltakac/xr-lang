# XR-Lang Metaprogramming Vision: AI-Augmented Self-Evolving Meta-System

## Core Problem: Hot-Reload vs Runtime State

When hot-reloading resets everything to the DSL-defined state, it creates a jarring experience where carefully positioned cameras, adjusted objects, or runtime discoveries are lost. This conflicts with the exploratory nature of 3D environment development.

## The Vision: Living, Learning, Conversational Creative Partner

Combining homoiconic DSL, metaprogramming, and AI to create what Alan Kay envisioned: a **meta-medium** that can dynamically become any other medium, where the boundary between thinking and doing, between idea and implementation, becomes fluid and natural.

## Three-Layer State System

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Source DSL (.xrdsl)         │ <- Design-time state
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│    Runtime Overrides (.runtime)     │ <- Session state  
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│     Active State (in memory)        │ <- Current state
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 1. Camera State Preservation & Meta-Behaviors

### Meta-Behavior System in DSL

```lisp
; Example DSL with meta-behaviors
(defscene3d my-scene
  (camera
    (position 0 5 10)
    (target 0 0 0)
    (meta preserve-runtime))  ; Keep runtime changes
    
  (object interactive-cube cube
    (position 0 0 0)
    (meta sync-to-code))  ; Write changes back to DSL
    
  (object reset-cube cube
    (position 5 0 0)
    (meta reset-on-reload))  ; Always reset (default)
    
  (ui-element status panel
    (position 0 4 0)
    (meta volatile))  ; Never persist
)
```

### Runtime Override System

```rust
struct RuntimeOverrides {
    camera_overrides: Option<CameraState>,
    object_overrides: HashMap<String, Transform>,
    preserve_flags: HashSet<String>,
}

impl SceneManager {
    fn reload_scene(&mut self, new_dsl: SceneData) {
        // Preserve marked runtime states
        let preserved = self.extract_preserved_state();
        
        // Load new DSL
        self.load_dsl(new_dsl);
        
        // Reapply preserved overrides
        self.apply_overrides(preserved);
    }
}
```

### Selective Code Sync

```rust
trait CodeSyncPolicy {
    fn should_sync(&self) -> bool;
    fn sync_interval(&self) -> Duration;
    fn format_value(&self, value: impl Into<DslExpr>) -> String;
}

// Smart sync that detects user edits
struct SmartSync {
    last_manual_edit: Instant,
    sync_buffer: Duration::from_secs(5), // Don't sync within 5s of manual edit
}
```

### Mode-Based System

```rust
enum AuthoringMode {
    Design,     // All changes reset on reload (current behavior)
    Play,       // Runtime changes preserved, not saved
    Live,       // Runtime changes sync to code
    Replay,     // Playback recorded interactions
}
```

### DSL Extensions for Fine Control

```lisp
(defmeta camera-sync
  (preserve position rotation)     ; Keep these on reload
  (sync-on-stop)                  ; Write to code when stopping
  (format "%.2f")                  ; Formatting for generated values
  (throttle 1000))                ; Max sync rate (ms)

(defbehavior exploratory
  (meta 
    (mode live)                   ; Enable two-way sync
    (target [position])            ; Only sync position
    (trigger on-drag-end)          ; When to sync
    (comment "/* auto */")))       ; Mark generated code
```

### Conflict Resolution

```lisp
; Generated section with timestamp
(camera
  (position 3.45 7.23 15.67)  ; /* auto: 2024-01-15 14:23:45 */
  (target 0.00 0.00 0.00)     ; /* manual */
  ...)
```

## 2. Self-Modifying Metaprogramming

### Macro System for Code Generation

```lisp
; Example: Interactive code evolution macro
(defmacro evolve-on-click [object-name evolution-strategy]
  `(defbehavior ,(symbol (str object-name "-evolver"))
     (state (generation 0)
            (mutations []))
     (on-click ()
       ; Analyze current scene structure
       (let ((scene-ast (parse-self))
             (context (analyze-interaction-patterns))
             (new-code (generate-evolution scene-ast context)))
         ; Write new behavior to file
         (update-source-code! new-code)
         (set! generation (+ generation 1))
         (push! mutations new-code)))))

; Complex example: Neural architecture search through interaction
(defmacro neural-architecture-builder [seed-network]
  `(defbehavior architecture-explorer
     (state (current-architecture ,seed-network)
            (performance-history [])
            (search-space (generate-search-space ,seed-network)))
     
     (on-interact (interaction-type position)
       (let* ((selected-layer (raycast-to-layer position))
              (mutation-type (classify-interaction interaction-type))
              (new-architecture 
                (case mutation-type
                  (:expand (add-parallel-branch selected-layer))
                  (:deepen (add-sequential-layer selected-layer))
                  (:prune (remove-redundant-paths selected-layer))
                  (:optimize (gradient-guided-mutation selected-layer)))))
         
         ; Generate new DSL code for the architecture
         (let ((new-scene-code (architecture->dsl new-architecture)))
           ; Update the source file with new architecture
           (write-to-source! 
             (replace-in-ast (current-source-ast)
                            'neural-architecture-definition
                            new-scene-code))
           
           ; Visualize the change
           (spawn-transition-effect selected-layer new-architecture))))))
```

### Interactive Compiler System

```lisp
; Example: Visual shader compiler that generates WGSL from 3D node graphs
(defmacro visual-shader-compiler []
  `(defscene3d shader-workshop
     (object shader-node-spawner cube
       (position -5 0 0)
       (scale 0.5 0.5 0.5)
       (behavior 
         (on-click ()
           ; Spawn a new shader node
           (let ((new-node (create-shader-node (random-shader-op))))
             ; Add to scene AST
             (add-to-scene! new-node)
             ; Update source code
             (append-to-source! (node->dsl new-node))))))
     
     (object compile-button cube
       (position 5 0 0)
       (scale 1 1 1)
       (color 0 1 0)
       (behavior
         (on-click ()
           ; Analyze all shader nodes and connections
           (let* ((graph (extract-shader-graph (current-scene)))
                  (wgsl-code (compile-graph->wgsl graph))
                  (dsl-shader (generate-shader-dsl wgsl-code)))
             
             ; Write new shader definition to source
             (update-source-section! 
               :shaders
               dsl-shader)
             
             ; Hot-reload with new shader
             (trigger-hot-reload!)
             
             ; Show compilation result
             (spawn-text-display wgsl-code)))))))
```

### Evolution Strategies through Interaction

```lisp
; Example: Genetic programming through 3D interaction
(defmacro genetic-behavior-evolver [initial-population]
  `(defbehavior genetic-controller
     (state (population ,initial-population)
            (fitness-scores {})
            (generation 0))
     
     (on-frame (dt)
       ; Each cube represents a genetic program
       (for-each [individual population]
         (execute-genetic-program individual dt)))
     
     (on-select (selected-object)
       ; User selection indicates fitness
       (update-fitness! selected-object (calculate-fitness)))
     
     (on-gesture (gesture-type)
       (case gesture-type
         ; Swipe up: reproduce selected
         (:swipe-up 
           (let* ((parents (get-selected-objects))
                  (offspring (crossover-and-mutate parents)))
             ; Generate new behavior code
             (let ((new-behavior-code (genome->behavior offspring)))
               ; Add to source file
               (append-behavior-to-source! new-behavior-code)
               ; Spawn visual representation
               (spawn-object-with-behavior offspring))))
         
         ; Swipe down: cull weak performers
         (:swipe-down
           (let ((weak (filter #(< (fitness %) threshold) population)))
             ; Remove from source
             (remove-behaviors-from-source! weak)
             ; Remove from scene
             (destroy-objects weak)))))))
```

### Live Pattern Language Development

```lisp
; Example: Building a pattern language through interaction
(defmacro pattern-recorder []
  `(defbehavior pattern-builder
     (state (recorded-patterns [])
            (current-recording nil))
     
     (on-key "R"
       ; Start recording interaction pattern
       (set! current-recording (new-pattern-recording)))
     
     (on-interaction (any)
       (when current-recording
         (record-interaction! current-recording any)))
     
     (on-key "S"
       ; Stop recording and generate macro
       (when current-recording
         (let* ((pattern (analyze-recording current-recording))
                (macro-code (pattern->macro pattern))
                (macro-name (generate-pattern-name pattern)))
           
           ; Write new macro to source file
           (prepend-to-source!
             `(defmacro ,macro-name []
                ,macro-code))
           
           ; Create visual representation of pattern
           (visualize-pattern pattern)
           
           ; Allow immediate use
           (eval-and-reload macro-code))))))
```

## Example Interaction Flow

```
Human: "Create something that responds to music"
AI: "I'll create an audio-reactive particle system. What mood?"
Human: "Ethereal and flowing"
AI: [Generates DSL code for particle system]
    [Shows preview in 3D world]
    "I've created flowing particles that respond to frequency bands. 
     Would you like me to explain the behavior logic?"
Human: "Make it more responsive to bass"
AI: [Modifies code, highlighting changes]
    "I've increased the bass frequency multiplier and added a 
     resonance behavior. Watch this..."
    [Demonstrates with music]
Human: "Perfect! Now save this as a reusable pattern"
AI: [Generates macro from interaction]
    "I've created a macro called 'audio-reactive-flow' that you 
     can parameterize. Should I add it to your pattern library?"
```

## Key Innovations

1. **AI as Co-Creator**: Not just a tool, but a collaborative partner
2. **Conversational Metaprogramming**: Natural language drives system evolution
3. **Explainable Everything**: Every AI action can be understood and questioned
4. **Living Memory**: System remembers and learns across sessions
5. **Multimodal Synthesis**: Voice, video, code, and 3D seamlessly integrated
6. **Time as First-Class**: Navigate, branch, and understand causality
7. **Symbiotic Evolution**: Human creativity + AI capabilities = emergent innovation

## Key Benefits

1. **Living Documentation**: Code becomes self-documenting through interaction
2. **Exploratory Programming**: Discover patterns by doing, not planning
3. **Emergent Complexity**: Simple interactions generate sophisticated behaviors
4. **Learning System**: The environment improves through use
5. **Creative Coding**: Blur the line between using and programming

## UI/UX Considerations

- 🔴 Recording indicator when in sync mode
- 📌 Pin icon to lock/preserve specific values  
- 🔄 Sync status in status bar
- Toggle keys: `[M]` for mode, `[P]` to preserve current view

## Implementation Path Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Implement camera position preservation only
2. **Add Opt-in**: Add `(meta preserve)` directive
3. **Extend Gradually**: Add more sophisticated policies
4. **Monitor Usage**: Learn from user patterns
5. **Refine UX**: Adjust based on feedback

This creates an **optimal human-machine symbiosis** where AI augments creativity rather than replacing it, enabling exploration and evolution of 3D worlds through natural interaction and conversation. The system embodies Alan Kay's vision of computing as an amplifier for human imagination, where the boundary between thinking and doing, between idea and implementation, becomes fluid and natural.
