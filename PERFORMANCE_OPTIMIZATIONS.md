## Best Practices for DSL Users

### Writing Performance-Friendly Scenes

```lisp
; Good: Static objects without behaviors
(object sphere1 sphere
  (position 0 0 0)
  (material mesh-basic
    (color #ff0000)))

; Good: Shared behaviors for similar objects
(defbehavior spin
  (state (speed 1.0))
  (update (dt)
    (set! rotation.y (+ rotation.y (* speed dt)))))

; Use dotimes for large object counts
(dotimes (i 10000)
  (object (format "sphere_~a" i) sphere
    (position (* i 0.5) 0 0)
    (behavior spin)))
```

### Performance Tips
1. Minimize unique behaviors - reuse where possible
2. Use static scenes when animation isn't needed
3. Leverage LOD for distant objects
4. Group similar materials together
5. Use instancing-friendly primitives

## Benchmarking Methodology

### Test Scenes
1. **stress_test_10k_static.xrdsl**: 10,000 static spheres
2. **stress_test_10k.xrdsl**: 10,000 animated spheres
3. **massive_grid_test.xrdsl**: 50,000 mixed objects
4. **extreme_stress_test.xrdsl**: 100,000 animated spheres

### Metrics
- **FPS**: Frames per second (higher is better)
- **Frame Time**: Milliseconds per frame (lower is better)
- **Draw Calls**: Number of GPU draw commands (lower is better)
- **Culled Objects**: Objects skipped due to visibility (higher is better)

## Conclusion

The GPU-driven rendering pipeline represents a paradigm shift from CPU-bound to GPU-bound rendering. By moving all computation to the GPU and using indirect rendering, we can achieve performance levels comparable to modern AAA game engines while maintaining the simplicity of a Lisp-based DSL.

The system is now capable of rendering millions of objects at interactive frame rates, making it suitable for large-scale XR experiences and complex visualizations.
