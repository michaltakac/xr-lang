# Stage A: Seed System Implementation

## Overview

Stage A establishes the **homoiconic foundation** for XR-Lang, implementing the core value system, bytecode VM, persistence layer, and scene primitives. This foundation enables the language to treat code as data, setting the stage for powerful metaprogramming capabilities.

## Completed Components

### 1. Homoiconic Value Model (`vm/src/value.rs`)
✅ **Implemented** - A comprehensive value system supporting:
- **Primitives**: nil, bool, int, float, string
- **Symbolic**: symbols and keywords
- **Collections**: lists, vectors, maps, sets
- **Code as Data**: AST nodes, quoted expressions
- **Extended Types**: closures, macros, capabilities, channels
- **Metadata Support**: values can carry metadata

**Key Achievement**: True homoiconicity - code is represented as data structures the language can manipulate.

### 2. Stack-Based Bytecode VM (`vm/src/bytecode.rs`)
✅ **Implemented** - Simple but complete virtual machine:
- Stack-based execution model
- Basic arithmetic and logical operations
- List manipulation (cons, car, cdr)
- Control flow (jump, conditional jumps)
- Variable binding and lookup
- Support for quote/eval
- Debug tracing capability

**Design Philosophy**: "Clarity over optimization" - focusing on correctness first, performance later.

### 3. EDN-like S-Expression Parser (`vm/src/parser.rs`)
✅ **Implemented** - Rich syntax while maintaining homoiconicity:
- S-expressions: `(+ 1 2)`
- Vectors: `[1 2 3]`
- Maps: `{:key "value"}`
- Sets: `#{1 2 3}`
- Keywords: `:keyword`
- Metadata: `^{:doc "..."} value`
- Comments: `; comment`
- Quote support: `'(quoted expr)`

**Innovation**: Richer literal syntax than traditional Lisp while preserving the essential property that code and data share the same representation.

### 4. Journal & Snapshot Store (`vm/src/persistence.rs`)
✅ **Implemented** - Event-sourced persistence with time-travel:
- Event journal tracking all changes
- Snapshot system for efficient time-travel
- Branching timelines support
- Provenance tracking (Human/AI/System/Generated)
- Conflict resolution strategies
- State reconstruction at any point in time

**Problem Solved**: Addresses Smalltalk's "image drift" problem through event-sourcing and clean separation of concerns.

### 5. Scene Primitives as Intrinsics (`vm/src/intrinsics.rs`)
✅ **Implemented** - Performance-critical 3D operations in Rust:
- Scene object creation (cameras, cubes, spheres)
- Transform manipulation (position, rotation, scale)
- Scene graph management
- Native function interface for XR-Lang

**Strategy**: Heavy computation in Rust, orchestration in XR-Lang - following Lisp's FFI tradition.

## Architecture Alignment

The implementation follows the recommended architecture from the language design review:

```
Phase 1 Distribution (Current):
- ~45% Rust (Parser, VM, Intrinsics, Persistence core)
- ~55% XR-Lang (Will be: DSL, Macros, Behaviors)
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Homoiconicity First**: Every design choice prioritizes the ability to treat code as data
2. **Simple Core**: Following Lisp/Smalltalk tradition of minimal, regular semantics
3. **Hybrid Bootstrapping**: Rust for performance-critical parts, XR-Lang for high-level logic
4. **Event Sourcing**: Comprehensive history tracking enables time-travel debugging
5. **Capability-Based Security**: Built into the value model from day one

## Demonstrations

### Example 1: Homoiconicity in Action
```lisp
; Parse code into data
(def code '(+ 1 2))

; Examine the structure
(first code)  ; => '+
(rest code)   ; => '(1 2)

; Modify the code as data
(def new-code (cons '* (rest code)))  ; => '(* 1 2)

; Evaluate the modified code
(eval new-code)  ; => 2
```

### Example 2: Scene Definition
```lisp
(defscene3d demo
  (camera 
    (position [0 5 10])
    ^{:preserve-runtime true})  ; Metadata for hot-reload preservation
  (cube
    (position [0 0 0])
    (behavior rotate-on-click)))
```

### Example 3: Time-Travel Debugging
```lisp
(with-time-travel
  (create-cube [0 0 0])     ; Checkpoint created
  (move-object cube [5 0 0]) ; Change recorded
  (scale-object cube 2.0)    ; Change recorded
  ; Can travel back to any point
  (travel-to! (- (now) 1000)))
```

## Testing

Comprehensive integration tests in `vm/tests/stage_a_integration.rs` demonstrate:
- ✅ Code as data manipulation
- ✅ EDN syntax parsing
- ✅ VM bytecode execution
- ✅ Scene primitive operations
- ✅ Persistence and time-travel
- ✅ Complete workflow integration

## Next Steps (Stage B: Homoiconic Core)

With the foundation in place, Stage B will implement:
1. **Macro Expander in XR-Lang** - Hygienic macros with gensym
2. **Metacircular Evaluator** - XR-Lang evaluating itself
3. **Compiler to Bytecode** - Written in XR-Lang
4. **Selective Persistence Policies** - Runtime preservation strategies

## Quotes from Language Design Review

> "XR-Lang's use of S-expression–like syntax and macro examples shows you're leveraging homoiconicity to allow code that writes code. This aligns perfectly with the Lisp ethos: a language adaptable to any domain by building domain-specific constructs within itself."

> "The vision hits all the right notes from a Lisp/Smalltalk perspective: image-based live development, extensibility through code-as-data, and an interactive 'conversation' with the system."

## Summary

Stage A successfully establishes the **homoiconic foundation** that will enable XR-Lang to become a truly self-modifying, meta-programmable language for XR development. The implementation follows best practices from decades of Lisp and Smalltalk development while incorporating modern features like event-sourcing and rich literal syntax.

**Status**: ✅ Stage A Complete - Ready for Stage B (Homoiconic Core)
