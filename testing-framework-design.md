# XR-Lang Testing Framework: Time-Travel, Recording-Based, AI-Enhanced Testing

## Core Philosophy: Testing as Exploration

Testing in XR-Lang isn't just validation—it's exploration, understanding, and evolution. Tests are first-class citizens that can be visualized in 3D, manipulated through time, and evolved through AI assistance.

## 1. Testing Primitives in DSL

### Basic Test Definition

```lisp
; Simple test definition
(deftest "camera preserves position on reload"
  (setup
    (create-camera (position 5 10 15)))
  
  (actions
    (move-camera (position 10 20 30))
    (trigger-hot-reload))
  
  (assertions
    (assert-eq (camera-position) (position 10 20 30))
    (assert-preserved camera)))

; Property-based testing with AI generation
(defproperty "object transformations are reversible"
  (generators
    (random-transform (ai-generate-transform-sequence)))
  
  (invariant (transform)
    (let ((obj (create-object cube)))
      (apply-transform obj transform)
      (apply-transform obj (inverse transform))
      (assert-identity (object-state obj)))))
```

### Recording-Based Test Generation

```lisp
; Tests can be generated from recordings
(defrecording-test "user-interaction-flow"
  (meta (record-mode interactive))  ; Start recording mode
  
  ; User performs actions in 3D environment
  ; System automatically generates test from recording
  
  (playback
    (speed 2.0)  ; Playback at 2x speed
    (visualize true)  ; Show in 3D during test
    (assert-no-errors)
    (assert-final-state expected-scene)))

; Snapshot testing with visual diffs
(defsnapshot-test "scene-rendering"
  (setup (load-scene "test-scene.xrdsl"))
  
  (snapshots
    (at-time 0 "initial-state.snapshot")
    (at-time 1000 "after-animation.snapshot")
    (at-interaction click "post-click.snapshot"))
  
  (compare-with
    (tolerance 0.01)  ; Allow minor variations
    (highlight-diffs true)))
```

### Time-Travel Testing

```lisp
; Test through temporal navigation
(deftemporal-test "state-consistency-through-time"
  (timeline
    (branch "main"
      (at 0 (create-object sphere))
      (at 100 (modify-color red))
      (at 200 (scale-by 2)))
    
    (branch "alternate"
      (from 100  ; Branch from main at t=100
        (modify-color blue)
        (rotate-by 45))))
  
  (assertions
    (at-all-times (assert-no-memory-leaks))
    (at-branch-points (assert-deterministic))
    (between-branches (assert-divergence-after 100))))

; Causality testing
(defcausality-test "action-consequence-chains"
  (trace-effects
    (action (delete-object parent-cube))
    (assert-effects
      (deleted child-cube-1)
      (deleted child-cube-2)
      (orphaned particle-system)
      (triggered cleanup-behavior))))
```

## 2. Side-Effect Isolation & Mathematical Reasoning

### Pure Function Testing

```lisp
(defpure-test "transformation-functions"
  (meta (isolated true))  ; Run in isolated environment
  
  (given
    (matrix (random-matrix-4x4))
    (vector (random-vector-3)))
  
  (properties
    ; Mathematical properties
    (associative (multiply matrix))
    (commutative (add vector))
    (distributive (scale-and-add))
    (identity (multiply-by-identity)))
  
  (side-effects
    (assert-no-io)
    (assert-no-mutations)
    (assert-deterministic)))
```

### Effect System Integration

```lisp
(defeffect-test "resource-management"
  (effects-allowed [gpu-allocation network-io])
  
  (measure
    (gpu-memory-before)
    (network-calls-count))
  
  (action
    (load-texture "large-texture.png")
    (send-telemetry))
  
  (assert-effects
    (gpu-memory-delta (less-than 100mb))
    (network-calls (exactly 1))
    (no-other-effects)))

; Monad-style effect tracking
(defmonadic-test "state-transformations"
  (state-monad
    (initial (scene-state {}))
    (transformations
      (>>= add-object)
      (>>= modify-position)
      (>>= apply-physics))
    (assert-pure-transformation)
    (extract-final-state)))
```

          (self-correct! failure)
          (search-web-for-solution failure)

           (similar-bugs (search-bug-database root-cause))
           (fix-strategies (generate-fix-strategies root-cause)))
      
      ; Try fixes in order of confidence

    (topology-preservation
      (euler-characteristic mesh))
    
    (causality-ordering
      (happens-before relation)))
  
  (prove
    (by-induction base-case inductive-step)
    (by-contradiction assumption)
    (by-exhaustion all-cases)))

### Terminal Usage

```bash
# AI generates test from description
xr-lang test --ai "test that particles follow physics laws"

# Record interaction and generate test
xr-lang test --record --interact
# ... perform actions in 3D environment ...
# [SPACE] to finish recording
# AI analyzes recording and generates test code

# Run specific test with visualization
xr-lang test camera-preservation --viz --debug

# Time-travel test debugging
xr-lang test failing-test --timeline --step-through

# Mutation testing with AI analysis
xr-lang test --mutate --ai-analyze-survivors
```

### 3D Environment Usage

```lisp
; In 3D environment, speak to AI
"Hey AI, test this cube's physics"
; AI generates and runs test in real-time

; Visual test creation by demonstration
"Record my actions as a test"
; Perform interactions
"Stop recording and generate test"
; AI creates test from demonstration

; Time-travel test review
"Show me why this test failed"
; AI visualizes the failure causality chain in 3D
```

## 10. Self-Improving Test System

```lisp
(defsystem test-evolution
  (on-test-run (results)
    ; Learn from test patterns
    (update-test-intelligence results)
